# Heart_Rate_Forecasting_Using_Machine_Learning

Welcome to Week 19 of the Weekly MachineHack Hackathon Series!
This week’s challenge revolves around developing a predictive model for heart rate forecasting. Accurate heart rate predictions are vital in various fields, from healthcare and fitness monitoring to enhancing wearable technology.

Participation and Benefits:
Skill Level: This challenge is ideal for participants with experience in time series analysis, regression modeling, and feature engineering.
Community Engagement: Join our Telegram group to collaborate with peers, ask questions, and share insights.
Recognition: All participants will receive a MachineHack certificate, and top performers will be highlighted on the leaderboard.
Submission and Evaluation:
Submission Format: Submit your predictions in the provided Submission.csv file.
Evaluation Metric: Submissions will be evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Leaderboard: Track your ranking and compete for the top spot!
How to Approach the Challenge:
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Normalize physiological data for consistent scaling.
Feature Engineering:

Derive meaningful features such as average heart rate per activity, time intervals, or contextual trends like weekends vs. weekdays.
Modeling Techniques:

Experiment with regression models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or deep learning methods like LSTM or Transformer-based architectures for sequential data.
Validation and Tuning:

Apply k-fold cross-validation and optimize hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
